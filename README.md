# Zerith — A Regenerative Energy Vision

Zerith is a regenerative energy framework designed to unlock ultra-low-cost, fuel-free energy by rethinking how natural differentials and system cycles can be used to generate power. This repository serves as a cryptographically authenticated archive for signed documents, blockchain proofs, and the encrypted vault protecting the foundational intellectual property.

> "Zerith isn’t just clean energy. It’s a new logic for energy — one that regenerates, not consumes."

## 🔐 Proof of Authenticity & Integrity

All project documents are cryptographically protected:

- **PGP/GPG Signatures:** Each document is digitally signed using [Kleopatra](https://files.gpg4win.org/gpg4win-4.4.0.exe).
- **Blockchain Timestamps:** Verified on Base and Bitcoin networks.
- **Encrypted Vault:** Hosted securely on OneDrive via [Cryptomator](https://cryptomator.org).

### ✅ How to Verify a Document:
```bash
gpg --verify filename.pdf.sig filename.pdf
```

> Example signature validation:

You can also verify the SHA-256 hash of each document against the hashes listed in the `HASHES/` folder.

## 🌍 Philosophy & Disclosure Pathways

Zerith was not created for secrecy — it was created for stewardship. Full technical disclosure is intentionally phased to ensure:
- Ethical implementation
- Avoidance of monopolization
- Protection from misuse before maturity

### Disclosure Model

1. **Institutional release** — Under ethical licensing and scientific partnership.
2. **Phased kits** — Educational and simplified versions for early adoption in vulnerable communities.
3. **Emergency release** — A dead man’s switch will publish the full encrypted archive if the founder is forcibly silenced or incapacitated.

The vision: protect today, share tomorrow.
